    "Our data set was looking to predict whether a person would default on their credit card payment based on gender, age, marital status and education level, as well as the original amount of credit. For each month Sept-April, it there are attributes for their history of payment (whether they paid on time or how far delayed their payment is), the amount of their last payment, and the amount of their bill. The class label we are trying to predict is whether they will default on their payment the next month.\n",

    "Since our table has around 30 thousand instances and kNN is rather slow, we used a random subset of our data in our tests.  \n",
    "We thought we should remove the first column of our table, which was ID, because the order these instances happen to be in shouldn't be of relevance to whether they will make their next payment, and it was not included on the list of attributes for the dataset. Initially we had ID and oddly enough removing it led to lower recall, precision, and F-measure for different k values. Without removing ID, it was often amongst the top attributes in the top subset. From visual inspection of our data, it did not appear that the class label was sorted in any way. "

Before removing ID, these forms of classifier evaluation all tended to be highest in the upper 60 to 100 range, after which they would drop off. After removing ID, around 100 was best for accuracy and recall, but precision and f-measure were much higher, so much so as to be basically using the majority from all training instances. At this point, we created the zero-R classifier above which showed that these Ks were not achieving the same accuracy as simply guessing the majority class, 0."
